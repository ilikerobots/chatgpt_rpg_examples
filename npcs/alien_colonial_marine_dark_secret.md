Dark Secret: John Doe was dishonorably discharged from the military after being caught stealing supplies meant for a civilian colony. He was then recruited into the Colonial Marines as a means to work off his sentence. He continues to struggle with his addiction to stolen goods and often takes things that aren't his during missions, putting his team in danger.

Notes: Despite his dark secret, John is a talented and experienced marine. He is a valuable asset to his team in combat, but his trustworthiness is always in question.
